# PlayNow Frontend - Angular 17

A modern turf booking application built with Angular 17, featuring the latest Angular features and best practices.

## 🚀 Angular 17 Power Features Used

### 1. Standalone Components
All components are standalone, eliminating the need for NgModules:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, RouterModule],
  template: `...`,
  styles: [`...`]
})
export class HomeComponent { ... }
```

### 2. Lazy Loading with Standalone Components
Modern lazy loading using `loadComponent()`:
```typescript
export const routes: Routes = [
  { 
    path: '', 
    loadComponent: () => import('./features/home/home.component').then(m => m.HomeComponent) 
  }
];
```

### 3. Signals for State Management
Reactive state management with signals instead of BehaviorSubject:
```typescript
// Instead of BehaviorSubject
const playerName = signal('Gopi');
playerName.set('Hinata');

// Computed signals for derived state
const isFormValid = computed(() => {
  return form.playerName.trim() !== '' && form.turfId !== '';
});
```

### 4. Modern Dependency Injection
Services with signals and computed values:
```typescript
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class BookingService {
  private bookings = signal<Booking[]>([]);
  public readonly totalBookings = computed(() => this.bookings().length);
}
```
